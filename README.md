# Touch-Sensitive-Doorbell-system.
Touch Sensitive Doorbell System is a second-year engineering mini project demonstrating basic electronics and transistor switching. It uses human body conductivity to trigger a BC547 transistor, activating a DC buzzer and LED. The circuit is built on a breadboard using simple, low-cost components.
